*This project creates Monoms and Polynoms and has a number of functions that interact with them/
The functions that operate in monom:
1)Adding one monom to another.
2)Multiplying one monom to another.
3)Checking equality.
4)Returns the value of a given x in the function.
5)If the monom equal to zero.
Does the derivative of the monom.

The functions that operate with polynoms:
1)Adding to the polynom monom/polynom.
2)Subtracting to the polynom monom/polynom.
3)Multiplying to the polynom monom/polynom.
4)Checking equality.
5)Returns the value of a given x in the function.
6)If the polynom equal to zero.
7)Does the derivative of the monom/polynom.
8)Calculating the area between the function and above the x axis.
9)Calculating the root of the function.



The project can construct monoms and polynoms from strings,as long as the string is representing a valid monom/polynom.
Examples for valid strings for monom:
"2","x^4","-x".
Examples for valid strings for polynom:
"-x+4","x^2+3x-5","x^5+1".

******
Important:
X(capital letter) is not a valid input,
as well as the sign '+' at the begining.
Because the polynom is made of monoms, an invalid string of polynom will create a polynom from the valid figures in the string, if there is any.
